### Before The Leaves Turned Red

The day before the leaves turned red,  
I swore as I turned seventeen  
To put a bullet through his head. 
The day before, the leaves turned red,  
I found him dying, in his bed.  
*Bury me on a hill so green…*  
The day before the leaves turned red.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swore, as I turned seventeen.

He always came back on a train  
The day before the leaves turned red.  
She always waited in the rain  
He always came back, on a train,  
Or so she told herself again.  
One day, I heard her, sick in bed:  
*He always comes back on a train*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The day before the leaves turn red.*

The day before, the leaves turned red,  
My Mother whispered in my ear,  
Half dreaming on her velvet bed.  
The day before, the leaves turned red,  
She said to me, and kissed my head:  
*Bring him back. Please. To me. My dear…*  
The day before the leaves turned red.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Mother whispered in my ear.

I saw her on that velvet bed -  
*Bury me on a hill so green*  
*Please. Before all the leaves turn red.*  
I saw her, on that velvet bed,  
I heard what her purple lips said.  
On the day I turned seventeen,  
I saw her! On that velvet bed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Bury me, on a hill so green.*

The day before, the leaves turned red,  
I found him, hooked to some machine.  
It said that he’s gone on ahead,  
The day before the leaves turned red…   
*I’ll put a bullet through your head!*  
Or so I swore. Oh, seventeen.  
The day before, the leaves turned red,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found him, hooked to some machine.

I found him, like my Mother said  
On the day I turned seventeen.  
What good are they now? Vows and lead?  
I found him like my Mother. Dead.  

What the hell good are you? In this bed?  
*Come back! To the day I was seventeen!*  
*Come back! Listen to what she said!*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Bring him back. When the leaves are still green.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Bring him back to me. Please. My dear.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Please. Before all the leaves turn red.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*He promised. He swore. To come back on the train.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*To bury me. On a hill. So green.*
