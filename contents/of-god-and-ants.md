Mr. Joe is a teacher.

Mr. Joe wakes up at 6:30 every morning, spends 30 minutes brushing his teeth, shitting, shaving and showering, sometimes in that order. Then, Mr. Joe eats his breakfast, usually cereal and milk, or, if he feels like working for it, PB and J. Then, Mr. Joe checks his phone for 5 minutes. That bitch ex wife of his is in Santorini with her husband. Then, Mr. J gets in his car, turns on the radio, drives past three blocks to Middleton middle school, parks in his assigned lot, gets out of the car, walks to the teacher’s building, walks to the mini kitchen, takes out his mug from the cupboard, presses the cappuccino button on the coffee machine, puts the mug under the valve, pours in some cream and sugar, stirs the mixture, takes a sip, walks to his cubicle, sits down, opens his bag, and pulls out the folder for today’s class.

Perfectly, every day.

Today’s lesson is biology: insects, or more accurately, the class Insecta. Mr. Joe stands in front of the class and quotes the passage he has quoted countless times during his five unvaried years in the same classroom, with the same whiteboard, the same skeleton model in the corner, and the same bookshelf, stuffed with books with plain, toneless hardcovers.

 “... have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body, three pairs of jointed legs, …”. The same exact passage can be found quite easily on Wikipedia, but no one but Mr. Joe knows that. In this classroom, he is the one with the knowledge, and his students, well, his one student, is the one who has everything to learn, and that student is Timmy.

Timmy is a good student. He takes notes in class, and always listens to his teacher. When Timmy talks to Mr. Joe, fascination glimmers in his eyes, as if he is learning something new from every single syllable that comes out. Little Timmy has come very far, and Mr. Joe is very proud. He strives to make the boy better everyday, teaching him new things. Today, he’s doing that by teaching Timmy biology.

“Ants communicate with each other using sounds, touch, and most dominantly, pheromones, otherwise known as smells…” and Mr. Joe continues, Timmy attentively listening. After the scintillating monologue, it is time for the lab. The objective is to observe a miniature ant farm, and how the tiny six-legged creatures work together as a colony. 

Timmy, standing before his own little farm, beams with excitement. Without waiting for instructions, Timmy takes out a candy bar of some unknown brand and breaks it off into small crumbles, waiting for the ants. As clockwork, a nearby ant picks up the emanating sweetness, and follows suit. Soon, one ant becomes a trail of several dozens

“Do you see how all the workers follow a single trail to the food? The trail is actually made by the first ant who found the food, as he was making his way back to the colony. The others can then just follow the trail, strengthening it as they proceed, gradually identifying the best trail to the food source.” Mr. Joe said, smiling to Timmy, who is clearly fascinated by the process, his nose nearly touching the glass.

“In the case the trail is blocked, or destroyed, the ants scatter and the search begins anew.”

Timmy turns around, and gives Mr. Joe a smile and a nod, tilting his head a little. Mr. Joe is very pleased, and he becomes very excited to show Timmy something else.

“Timmy, did you know that ants can also use pheromones for different purposes. For example, …”  Mr. Joe reaches into the box and takes a worker from the trail, puts it in a corner, and promptly crushes it.

“A dead ant can still secret pheromones that warn other ants of danger. Look carefully.”

Some of the workers, apparently having picked up on the chemical, start towards the location of their unfortunate friend. Upon arrival, they find the crushed body, and moments later, their own demises. Mr. Joe proceeds to press his thumb on each of them, individually, and deliberately. The smell of the pheromones clings to his thumb.

“The stronger the scent, the more alert the colony will become. Repeating this enough time, we should be able to send the colony into an state of emergency, and these guys will become much more hostile. A complex system, from such simple creatures. Neat, don’t you think?”

Again comes the nod, and the smile. More ants arrive.

“Would you like a try?”

This time it is a shake of the head, still accompanied by that same tilting smile.

“Are you sure? It is quite a fun experiment, and don’t worry, their nervous systems are not developed enough to experience pain.”

Still the shake of the head, but this time, the smile wanes ever so slightly.

“Please, Timmy. For. My. Sake. Crush the ants.” Mr. Joe persists. He seems disappointed, he has hoped that Tim would share his enthusiasm. 

With no trace of his smile left, Tim reaches inside the glass box. His hand finds a victim in no time. His fingers close around the ant like a trash compactor. Then, another, and another, and another. As the odor of the dead ants becomes stronger, Tim’s face crumples into a convoluted mess of horror and pain, while Mr. Joe’s grows from a colorless pale shade to the pinkish red of frustration and rage.

Tim begins to sob, his entire body shaking as the ants die by his hand.

“Enough! Timmy! FOR. MY. SAKE. FREEZE!”

And Tim freezes, like a statue, the last few drops of tears rolling down his cheeks.

Mr. Joe stomps his way to the bookshelf, and removes the book numbered twenty seven. The shelf slowly slides the side, revealing a doorway. He walks through.

The room is large, and dark, and the only lights are the white flickerings from the triple monitor setup in the corner. Mr. Joe strides past a long row of large cylindrical capsules to the monitors. On the middle one, a video feed is running, showing an overhead view of the classroom: Tim, motionless. He turns to the left monitor.

Mr. Joe skims through the walls of numbers, shaking his head as he goes, and stops at the last line.

Subject currently experiencing values conflict, please reevaluate

He types in the console.


```bash
>>> exec -report attributes compatibility

---- Individual attribute compatibility ----

Obedience - 95.91%
Compassion - 90.12%
Selfishness - 10.23%
Curiosity - 0.27%

Conclusion: Subject incompatible with Curiosity.
Suggestion: Decrease Compassion and Obedience by twenty percent. Increase Selfishness by fifteen percent.
```

“GOD DAMN IT!”

Mr. Joe rams his fist into the wall, once, twice, thrice, … His knuckles start to bleed.

At punch number eleven, he decides to stop. He types again, hands still bloody.

```bash
>>> export -all Sims.data CuriosityProject

On the monitor, every detail of the classroom has vanished: The students, the desks, the windows. The remains are a frozen Tim, the antfarm, and the bookshelf.

Mr. Joe gets up, walks to the coffee machine at the other end of the room, and pours himself a cup of cappuccino. He takes a deep breath, enjoying the smell of the roasted coffee beans, and of his pheromones and blood soaked fingers. He downs the cup in one go.

“Lights on.” 

The room lights up, and Mr. Joe turns around to the capsules. Each one is made out of some sort of metal, save for a significant portion at the front, which seems to be of a semi transparent material. Each one also has a number etched on it at the top left corner: one, two, three, and so on. As he walks along the row, he can see the preserved brains, intact and frozen. At number twenty seven, he stops, and reaches to the side of the capsule. He finds a button, pushes it, and the contraption opens slowly. After a moment, a voice spoke, mechanically.

“Cryochamber number twenty seven initialized.”

Mr. Joe returns through the doorway. Surrounded by the white walls and the white floors, he looks at Tim, crouching, one hand in the box, eyes still open, still as a statue. The pungent odor of the pheromones has now permeated the room, Mr. Joe will have to do something about that. For now though, he needs to take care of his beloved Timmy.

Mr. Joe produces a small pouch from his pocket. He takes out a black sharpie, and with it traces a line around the skull of his student. Then comes the surgery knife, following the trail, effortless. Blood starts to seep, dripping, drop by drop to the ground. It is quite unfortunate that Tim is able to experience pain, but it can’t be helped. He removes the scalp, revealing the soft and mushy mass of tissues and neurons underneath. This has become something of a ritual, and Mr. Joe has come to enjoy it. The joy of creating new life, and of discovering new knowledge. It’s the same joy he experiences when crushing the ants. In time, Tim will come to enjoy it as well.
