The first time I drank, really drank, coffee  
Was when I was seventeen - long, long ago.  
It wasn’t just a cup of espresso;  
those I had before, and since, but you see...  
Never like this. I know it’s silly,  
but the first times, they never quite let go.  
Every first follows you like a shadow.  
Mine was that first cup, dripping black coffee,  

in an alley, with the guitar in the rain,  
the mouldy smell of some old newspapers,  
then the perfumes of the nearby food carts:  
roast ducks next to pig’s intestines and hearts,  
combined with the blend of rusty vapors  
from the peeling paint and the old bike parts.  
    
(I also remember,  
watching each black drop fell into the cup  
and the white jasmine flower on her hair…)  

To be frank though, I never really care  
for that wet, dirty alley anyway;  
ducks and pigs were quite decent, to be fair  
and the guitar, an adequate affair.  
But as for the mould, the damp, the rust there,  
as for that concoction, if I daresay:  
I don’t miss it, to put it in a nice way.  
Yet, the first times never quite let go, I swear.  

(How sweet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that cup of coffee.  
How sweet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that smell on her hair.  
How sweet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that age, seventeen… )
