My eyes actually work OK under perfect lighting conditions, but such conditions are rare now, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>Oh, but people? I see them, and I see them perfectly. I saw my first four years ago, when I was fourteen.</p>\n<p>It was Granny, somehow I just knew it, even though that was the first time I ever saw her. People were crying that day, offering condolences, but I only saw Granny. She was a tiny and frail lady, in a dress that was truly terrible, even for funerals. The dress was not blue everywhere though, there was a stain, dark and wet, on her midriff. I didn’t know why it was there.</p>\n<p>“Who you’re looking at kido?”</p>\n<p>I made no reply, and kept looking at her.</p>\n<p>“Now, it’s not polite to stare. Be a good boy and run to your parents.”</p>\n<p>“Granny, what’s that dark spot on your dress?”</p>\n<p>“Huh? I don’t know what you’re talking about. Run along now, shoo.”</p>\n<p>Mom and Dad were talking to some people. Dad had carried his gun, he fired a “three-shot volley,” a little while before. He told me it was a tradition. Military man and all.</p>\n<p>I didn’t mention Granny to Mom and Dad. I knew they couldn’t see her.</p>\n<p>Granny stuck around for a few days, following me around. She told me a story, “The River of Styx”.</p>\n<p>Then she was gone, I never saw her again.</p>\n<p>More came since. A man in a suit, only he didn’t have any arms or legs. A kid about my own age with a hole where his left eye should be. A woman with a knife sticking out of her neck. They always knew I could see them.</p>\n<p>“Do you have the time? I think I am late for a meeting.”</p>\n<p>“I saw a gun under my Dad’s desk. I’ve never touched one before and I wanted to try.”</p>\n<p>“Can you help me? Me, and my husband, we were fighting, and now he left and I can’t find him anywhere.”</p>\n<p>So on and so on.</p>\n<p>Like grandma, they didn’t talk much.It was perfectly fine for me, it was their faces I was interested in. I could see, for the first time. The glint in their eyes, the beads of sweat on their faces, and sometimes, the blood flowing from their open veins. How strange. I’d never seen that color before. Mom told me it was red. I really liked that. Red.</p>\n<p>I saw them almost every day. I saw more than I could remember, and of those I could, I chose the best faces and saved them, for later use. The face of the limbless businessman became the face of Uncle Gary whenever he visited. The face of the kid with the hole for a left eye became the face of my next door buddy Tom, but with a proper eye instead of the hole. The face of the woman with the knife sticking out of her neck became the face of my teacher, Mrs. Delgaldo, somehow I couldn’t picture her neck without the knife though.</p>\n<p>So on and so on.</p>\n<p>Some days, no one would show up. I couldn’t see anyone. I remembered I always felt a little sad on those days. Mom and Dad would try to cheer me up.</p>\n<p>I was in the kitchen, having just finished the microwaved pizza from last night. Mom was in her room, crying no doubt, she had been doing that since morning. Dad was downstairs, in the living room, chatting with his new buddy, who just came by this morning. I opened the door for him, told him to make himself comfortable on the sofa and wait for Dad. It wasn’t him I was scared of, he couldn’t see anyway.</p>\n<p>I could. I could see. I just needed to open my eyes.</p>\n<p>Come on, deep breath.</p>\n<p>I walked out of the kitchen, and upstairs, slowly. It wasn’t because of my eyes, I knew where everything was. Mom’s room is past these stairs, 7 steps, left and that’s the door. Just need to open it, and step in. No. I was, in truth, scared. I stood in front of Mom’s room, hand sweating on the knob.</p>\n<p>Here we go, moment of truth.</p>\n<p>Stepping in the room, I saw mom, lying on the bed, head on her arm. Her eyes were swelling, and red. She didn’t even hear me come in. Mom was like that, when she had something on her mind, like she did right now, everything else just flew right past her. I sat down next to her, my hands wrapping around hers.</p>\n<p>“Mom?”</p>\n<p>“Yes… h-honey?”</p>\n<p>“Who’s dad talking to?”</p>\n<p>“It’s his old college friend, he’s in town… for a few days.”</p>\n<p>At this, she started crying again. I could see her face so clearly, the tears rolling through the creases of her skin, the freckles on her puffy nose, the blood red cheeks perspiring, and the small, petite mouth with thin lips. I was staring at her, while the red stream from her chest ebbed and flowed to the rhythm of her breath.</p>\n<p>Wow.</p>\n<p>“Mom, it’s ok, I’ll come down and check on Dad, everything will be fine. I love you.”</p>\n<p>“I-I love you too.”</p>\n<p>Walking back down the stairs, I realized I had just seen my own mother, really seeing her, for the first time. How beautiful she was. I was really glad.</p>\n<p>Down the stairs, 15 steps to the right. Dad and his buddy were still talking. Well, Dad did, his buddy hadn’t said anything. Dad usually did most of the talking. Hearing me coming, he turned around.</p>\n<p>“There you go. Can you go in the fridge and get me a beer, get one for Mikey here too.”</p>\n<p>Dad had got a short buzz cut, military man and all. His eyes were brown (I think it’s brown), and for a second I envied Mom, looking into those eyes. So safe. So unassuming. I’d decided: he was a handsome man, maybe not as stunning as Mom, but still, a handsome man. His shirt was soaked. It seemed to be black.</p>\n<p>“Do I have something on my face?”</p>\n<p>His question barely registered. That soothing rhythm.</p>\n<p>Tip, tap, tip, tap.</p>\n<p>Drop by drop, breath by breath.</p>\n<p>“Earth to Dan. Hello?”</p>\n<p>Shit, I was staring, at my own father. Never got the chance before.</p>\n<p>I snapped out of it, turning to where I assumed his Dad’s buddy is.</p>\n<p>“Do you want something else other than beer? We have Coke, and juice.” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Just a water would be fine, thank you.” He said, coughing a little. He sounded anxious, for some reason.</p>\n<p>“How about that beer?” Dad repeated, a little annoyed now.</p>\n<p>“Yes sir, coming right up.” I flashed the biggest grin at Dad.</p>\n<p>15 steps back, and 10 steps more, the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Mom and Dad. Who would have thought? Of all the people I’d seen, they were just breathtaking.</p>\n<p>Crazy, to finally see them now. Crazy, to take that long to figure out how.</p>\n<p>I came into the kitchen, but not for the fridge. What I was looking for was on the dining table. Still warm to the touch. Military man and all. I picked it up, tucked it into my jeans and walked back up the stairs. Mom’s room again.</p>\n<p>It was rather easy, now that I thought about it. Dad was sitting on the sofa, dozing off, as the game was nearing its final minutes. Barcelona must have been losing.</p>\n<p>Mom was sound asleep, in her room. Her breaths were even, slow, and gentle.</p>\n<p>It probably didn’t hurt. I didn’t think it hurt if you were sleeping.</p>\n<p>Dad never taught me anything about these things, he must have thought there was no use to it. Not that I needed teaching, the gun felt comfortable in my hand, my fingers were already familiar to the metal grip, and I knew how to hold it, where to point to. Not the head, no. I wanted to see their faces, after all.</p>\n<p>7 steps, and turn left.</p>\n<p>Mom was sitting up now, her head tilted a little. She was not crying anymore. Her head tilted a little, and her lips curled up ever so slightly into a gentle smile. God, she looked so beautiful.</p>\n<p>“Honey, are you ok? You’re crying.”</p>\n<p>“Really, I didn’t realize… Mom, I’m sorry for taking so long. I’m sorry for making you cry. I’m sorry if it hurt.”</p>\n<p>She broke into a full smile, a smile with all the sweetness and love in the world. And her eyes, she were covering them before. The twinkle in them, that-that must be green, right?</p>\n<p>“Don’t be. I understand now.”</p>\n<p>I fell into her, trying to return what I saw in her smile. She held me, squeezed my shoulder, and slightly pushed me away. Her hands cupped my cheeks.</p>\n<p>“You know what to do now right?”</p>\n<p>Nodding, tears now flowing down my face, I stood up and walked four steps to the left. The mirror in the corner. Mom would help me. I felt her hands. Gentle. Soft. Looking in the mirror, her eyes were once more wet with tears. And that smile again. She kissed my hair.</p>\n<p>I felt the warm muzzle on my tongue. What a weird taste. I felt Mom’s fingers squeezing my fingers. I wondered if my eyes were green or brown.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seeing","date":"2018/01/13"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/seeing/"}}}
